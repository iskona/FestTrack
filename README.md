### User Story

As a concert and festival lover

I need to plan ahead for festivals or concerts

So that I can get most out of my experience

## Overview

For our first group project we were asked to come together as a team to solve a real world problem using data from multiple server-side API requests.

### Goals:

- Work together as a group
- Create a functional app to search for concert events
- Navigate the difficulties of a shared GitHub repo

### Two Server-Side APIs

We chose to work with Ticketmaster and Zomato for our project.

Ticketmaster provided us with a json object to manipulate that allowed us to display
the concert title, image, address, and link. With each user search we were able to limit
the search to 32 responses.

As happy as concerts make everyone, we knew we needed to bring more joy to the
world. That's where Zomato came in.

### CSS Framework: Semantic UI

The team loved working in Semantic. Unlike Bootstrap, the documentation for Semantic was easily digestable, and it's file is cleanly written and simple
to look at and understand. We were still able to create a responsive and great
layout, while giving us the space to explore our own design styles.

* Application stores previously searched for cities in `localStorage` and displays them to the user.

* Application loads the local events user's current location to the initial landing page.
